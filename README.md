# Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This project involves creating an interactive and insightful dashboard using Power BI Desktop to analyze bank loan data. The dashboard helps in visualizing key metrics related to loan applications, funded amounts, and received amounts, segmented by various categories.

## Features
- **Interactive Loan Summary Overview:** A comprehensive view of loan application percentages, applications, funded amounts, and total received amounts.
- **Detailed Grid View:** An interactive grid to drill down into specific details of loans categorized by loan status.
- **Visualization Charts:** Utilizes a variety of charts and graphs to represent data visually, making it easier to identify trends and patterns.

## Dashboard Sections

### DASHBOARD 1: SUMMARY

#### Part A. Good Loan vs Bad Loan KPIs

| Good Loan                                    | Bad Loan                                   |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| - Good Loan Application Percentage           | - Bad Loan Application Percentage          |
| - Good Loan Applications                     | - Bad Loan Applications                    |
| - Good Loan Funded Amount                    | - Bad Loan Funded Amount                   |
| - Good Loan Total Received Amount            | - Bad Loan Total Received Amount           |

#### Part B. Loan Status Grid View
In order to gain a comprehensive overview of our lending operations and monitor the performance of loans, we aim to create a grid view report categorized by 'Loan Status.' By providing insights into metrics such as 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' 'Total Amount Received,' 'Month-to-Date (MTD) Funded Amount,' 'MTD Amount Received,' 'Average Interest Rate,' and 'Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI),' this grid view will empower us to make data-driven decisions and assess the health of our loan portfolio.

### DASHBOARD 2: OVERVIEW

#### Charts
1. **Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart):** Identifies seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities.
2. **Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map):** Identifies regions with significant lending activity and assesses regional disparities.
3. **Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart):** Understands the distribution of loans across various term lengths.
4. **Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart):** Analyzes how lending metrics are distributed among borrowers with different employment lengths, helping to assess the impact of employment history on loan applications.
5. **Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart):** Provides a visual breakdown of loan metrics based on the stated purposes of loans, aiding in understanding the primary reasons borrowers seek financing.
6. **Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map):** Offers a hierarchical view of how home ownership impacts loan applications and disbursements.

**Metrics to be shown:** 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' and 'Total Amount Received'

### DASHBOARD 3: DETAILS

#### Grid
A comprehensive 'Details Dashboard' provides a consolidated view of all the essential information within our loan data. This Details Dashboard aims to offer a holistic snapshot of key loan-related metrics and data points, enabling users to access critical information efficiently.

**Objective:**
The primary objective of the Details Dashboard is to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for accessing vital loan data. It serves as a one-stop solution for users seeking detailed insights into our loan portfolio, borrower profiles, and loan performance.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Power BI Desktop:** Used for creating interactive and visually rich dashboards.
- **SSMS & MS SQL:** Used to perform queries to verify and validate the report.

## Methodology
1. **Data Import and Preparation:** Importing data into Power BI and using Power Query to clean and transform the data.
2. **Visualization Creation:** Building various visualizations, including bar charts, pie charts, and grids, to represent the loan data.
3. **Interactive Dashboard Design:** Designing an interactive dashboard that allows users to filter and drill down into specific details of the loan data.

## Usage
To use the dashboard:
1. Open the Power BI Desktop file.
2. Navigate through the interactive pages to explore the loan data.
3. Use the filters and drill-down features to analyze specific segments of the data.
